### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dan and I am currently working full time with Magento, although different to any framework I have worked with before, I am really enjoying it and the more I work with Magento the more I admire and enjoy working with it.

Aswell as my full time job, I also like to work on side projects, some of which you can see here on my Github account.

### âš¡ Fun facts about me: ...

- I enjoy weekends away, on my motorbike, camping.
- I have been learning to play the guitar for the past few years
- I first got in to programming around 2002 when I bought a magazine which came with a free copy of Visual Studio
